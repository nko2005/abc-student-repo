## Description:

Welcome to the Kaleido Tower an internet project in the making. It is a space where people contribute to a tower with infinite amount of floors. Anyone can access the website, draw their own horitzontal slice of the tower (using the provided drawing tools) and add it on top. Users can also add their name to be displayed with their created floor.

The rules of the tower are simple: You cannot view the tower unless you contribute to it, you must draw based on the specifications outlined for each floor.



## How it works:

I used p5.js canvas element to create the drawing functionality. Ofcourse I used express to serve the files that are hosted on glitched. The drawings are stored in a real-time database using firebase and I also use socket.io to add to the tower in real-time on the website.
