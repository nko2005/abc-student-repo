Nawaf Alotaishan   8/9/2021 Mini Project 1

For this mini project I explored the concept of multiplicity by creating a webpage with a slider in the middle. By turning the slider left or right the background color changes and a series of rectangles with different sizes and colors would randomize as you move the slider, the amount of rectangles also increase or decrease based on the slider. This mini project shows how through basic elements like shape, size, and color, multiple objects can be produced.

More technically though, in this project I used a flexbox and passed empty divs as the slider moved. The reason I went with this method is to take advantage of how the elements of a flexbox can be styled separately to the flexbox itself without needing to add a class to each div. As for the slider I applied what we learnt in last week's lab.
