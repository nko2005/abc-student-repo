For this project I used P5.js and pixel manipulation to create a colored square representation of each pixel in the image. As more users connect to the server and enter the site, the image becomes less and less block, making it clear that it is an image of the city of Shanghai. Some difficulties I faced is that when I enter using my mobile phone the website is very laggy even if I use a lower resolution image.
