For the internet, I agree with the statement that "context is king", as the internet and its users are always evolving from era to era, and net art also changes with it.  As Connor discusses net art do reflect and are in conversation with its surrounding context.  For example, with the internet's "corporate turn" Connor mentions Galloway's argument;
that is how after the corporate turn artists adopted the "aesthetics, functions, or persona of a corporation" (29). So, similarly how early net art reflect the spirit and potential of the interconnectivity of the internet (like Floodnet),  succeeding net arts reflect the new "commercial" context of the web.

Irony is a an effective tool in satire, and it applies in more than one way in the artwork Samsung (1999) by Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries. In this net art we see that the narrator is infatuated by Samsung and its ideal, but it is ambiguous in its irony because some people might see Samsung as a corporation that is aggressively surrounding their everyday life, while some Koreans might see Samsung as a national pride of the country. Moreover, we see that the artwork is ironic in how you need adobe flash player to run it: which is a proprietary corporate software.

The artwork Samsung (1999) by Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries. Situates itself in the "second age" of net art as Connor discusses. It released during the "corporate turn" of the internet. The artists here used the of strategy of creating “work that contains a relatively strong political and social intent, but is clothed […] in ironic ambiguity”. relative to the "archive" Conner describes the artwork as "revolving around language and its limits" (34) in relation to Foucault's concept of the archives.
