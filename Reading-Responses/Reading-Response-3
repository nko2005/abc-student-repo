For the internet, I agree with the statement that "context is king", as the internet and its users are always evolving from era to era, and net art also changes with it.
  As Connor discusses net art do reflect and are in conversation with its surrounding context.
  For example, with the internet's "corporate turn" Connor mentions Galloway's argument;
  that is how after the corporate turn artists adopted the "aesthetics, functions, or persona of a corporation" (29). So, similarly how early net art reflect the spirit and potential of the interconnectivity of the internet (like Floodnet),
  succeeding net arts reflect the new "commercial" context of the web.
