I do agree with Lialina that the old web "vernacular"  is much different when compared to contemporary web pages.
The web today has a more minimalistic design with simple colors and shapes. It reminds me when apple
let go of the skeuomorphic design of  ios 6 and adopted a more simple, colorful, and minimal desing of ios 7.


I think there is a significant importance in documenting and recording the state of the internet and the web.
Through it we can better understand the state of the web today, but also understand the intuition behind the web elements of the past; that is, how people perceived the web and interacted with it.
In essence, it provides a unique perepsctive of when the web wasn't as tightly entwined with our lives today.

As a student of web development it gave me some insight in what was considered a "well-designed" website. As the standard seem to keep evolving and changing over time, what is considered the best and popular might quickly go out of style in both amateur and professional contexts. We see this in the elements that Lialina covers, but also the web-page of the reading itself: the first part of the reading had a more dated design, however the more recent second part had a design that holds up much  better in the modern day web.
