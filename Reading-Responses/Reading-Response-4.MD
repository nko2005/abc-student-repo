How is spatiality consituted in the artists' works that are discussed?

Read both readings, take notes and write a short response (300-500). If available, add further associations that come to your mind while reading/thinking.

  Both Net arts were created during different eras of the internet. "Now You're in my computer" was before the advent of mass social media, and Cao Fei's RMB City
  was created at a time were MMOS were begining to become mainstream.
   It is important to understand some of the context surrounding the creation of the both arts as these context influence
    the significance of the virtiual space and how it's used as well as its scope.


When we see the work "Now You're in my computer" the digital space is used to present the daily activites and daily data surrounding people's lives outside of the digital space.
 Because social media and the habit of sharing personal day-to-day aspect of a person's life was absent, a visitor would feel that they are intruding into details they shouldn't be made aware of. Unlike the homepages of the early era of the internet, the appearence of the website didn't
  help keep visitor's mind at ease on the details that seemingly feel like they are maliciously leaked online. So, during that era of the internet the digital space is more commonly used to exchange and view information public information anonymously. The idea of having full visibility
  of your private life in digital spaces was uncomfortable. But with speed in which information travels and the ease of collecting such data was made apparent during that time, the visibility of a person's identity starts to bleed into the digital space.


On the other hand, Cao Fei's RMB city  digital space almost encourges hiding your actual self with a virtual one. With the popularization of MMOs online users expressing themselves with different personas characters and visual representation was catching on. This is in sharp contrast to the themes we see in the "Now You're IN my Computer" net art. Now with VR and better technology the ideas we see presented in Cao Fei's RMB City is becoming more and more realistic, espically with games such as VR chat that igves you the ability to socialize with different people in different looking avatars and in a variety of environments. Ultimately, both net arts and the different definitions of spatiality in the internet that they discuss  were ahead of their time.
