With the advent of the internet, there are different rules, etiquettes and expectations surrounding intimate relationships online. For instance, the images, photos and details you share on social media, do much more important work presenting you to others digitally, than you presenting yourself directly. With that comes the expectations of how frequently you post and how relevant the images you are sharing online are.   

I think how the internet's shift away from anonymity complicates the issue of having your own digital identity: your real life identity carries over to the digital one. It's just that you can shape, trim, and groom it to the best of your ability. As McHugh notes, for some this can be disappointing as they don't have complete control on how they represent themselves in a online intimate relationship, and anonymity.

However, I do believe that with the influence of the internet, there exist people who are "terminally online" and see the world through their digital experience and usually wouldn't detach the reality of the internet with the reality of well, reality. In other words their world view is mainly seen through the lens (pixels) of the screen. Similar to the concept of the "digital native"  that Mchaugh discusse, but I believe the existance of such is more problematic as a result of their narrow world view and perspective.
